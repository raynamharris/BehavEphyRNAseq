# BehavEphyRNAseq
This is where I store all the raw and processed data and scripts for a 5 year collaboration between the Fenton and Hofmann Labs. Then, little bits and pieces are broken off for the the four sub projects

The name comes from the longer "**Behav**ior **E**lectro**phy**siology **RNA** **seq**uencing", which are the three levels of analysis we incorporate to understand how experience alters brain and behavior. 

## Repo Contents
- [**data**]((./data/)): contains all the raw and processed data files. They are broken up into sub folders. 
- [**grantproposals**](./grantproposals/): we wrote a bunch of grants the last few years. here's a copy of two.
- [**markdownfiles**](./markdownfiles/): this contains all the .R and .Rmd scripts as well as the .md output files. They have prefixes to hint at the order of operation. 
- [**suppliesorders**](./suppliesorders/): the contains a copy of all the supplies I ordered over the years for molecular consumables and reagents.

## Workflow
All the data analyses for this project were conducted in R. Here is a brief overview of each of the .R or .Rmd files
