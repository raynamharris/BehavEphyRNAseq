# BehavEphyRNAseq
This is where I store all the raw and processed data and scripts for a 5 year collaboration between the Fenton and Hofmann Labs. Then, little bits and pieces are broken off for the the four sub projects

The name comes from the longer "**Behav**ior **E**lectro**phy**siology **RNA** **seq**uencing", which are the three levels of analysis we incorporate to understand how experience alters brain and behavior. 

## Repo Contents
- [**data**]((./data/)): contains all the raw and processed data files. They are broken up into sub folders. 
- [**grantproposals**](./grantproposals/): we wrote a bunch of grants the last few years. here's a copy of two.
- [**markdownfiles**](./markdownfiles/): this contains all the .R and .Rmd scripts as well as the .md output files. They have prefixes to hint at the order of operation. The workflow is described in more detail below
- [**supplies_orders**](./supplies_orders/): the contains a copy of all the supplies I ordered over the years for molecular consumables and reagents.
- [**results**](./results/): this contains all the figures generated by the .Rmd scripts

## Workflow
All the data analyses for this project were conducted in R. Here is a brief overview of each of the .R or .Rmd files

**Behavior**

**RNAseq**
- 02a_tidysamples.R
- 02b_kallistoDESeq2allsamples.Rmd

**Ephys**


**Miscellaneous**
- 99_DataWranglingForNsbProjects.Rmd: Some of the samples I collected were used by students in the NS&B course. This is the file I used to subset the data and create a sample information sheet for students
