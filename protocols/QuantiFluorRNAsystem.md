## Prepare the solutions
- [ ] Prepare (or obtain) **1X TE buffer** by diluting the 20X TE Buffer 20-fold with nuclease-free water. For example, add 1ml of 20X TE Buffer to 19ml of Nuclease-Free Water, and mix.
- [ ] Dilute the **QuantiFluor® RNA Dye** 1:2000 using 1X TE buffer. This is your working dye solution. For example, add 1.5μl of QuantiFluor® RNA Dye to 1,498.5μl of 1X TE buffer, and mix. Note: 1.5mL is a sufficient volume to process 14 samples or standards.
- [ ] Prepare a **Low-Concentration RNA Standard Curve** using the serial dilution scheme outlined 

Standard | Vol. RNA Standard | Vol. of 1X TE Buffer (μl)
---:|:---:|:---
0 | 25 μl RNA Standard | 475 μl 1X TE
A | 250 μl 0 | 250 μl 1X TE
B | 250 μl A | 250 μl 1X TE
C | 250 μl B | 250 μl 1X TE
D | 250 μl C | 250 μl 1X TE
E | 250 μl D | 250 μl 1X TE
F | 250 μl E | 250 μl 1X TE
G | 250 μl F | 250 μl 1X TE

## Prepare the samples
- [ ] Obtain and label a 0.5ml quantification tube for each sample and standard
- [ ] Add 95μl 1X TE Buffer to each tube
- [ ] Add 100μl working dye solution to each tube
- [ ] Add 5μl of sample or standard to the appropriate tube. Pipette up and down to mix
- [ ] Incubate assays for 5 minutes at room temperature, protected from light
- [ ] Place in the Quantas Fluorometer and measure the fluorescence.
